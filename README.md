Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Project Overview
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover key factors influencing passenger survival. 
The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between survival and variables such as gender, passenger class, age, and fare.

Objectives
Examine the dataset structure and identify missing data.
Analyze distributions and relationships among features.
Identify key patterns affecting survival rates.
Visualize trends and correlations using statistical and graphical methods.

Key Findings
Survival rates were significantly higher for females compared to males.
Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better survival chances than those in lower classes.
Higher ticket fares positively correlated with survival.
Age was not a strong predictor of survival; survivors and non-survivors had overlapping age ranges.

Tools and Techniques
Python libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Statistical summaries and correlation analysis
Visualization with pairplots and distribution charts

Conclusion
Gender, passenger class, and fare paid were the most influential factors for survival on the Titanic, while age had minimal impact. 
This analysis provides insight into the socio-economic and demographic factors affecting survival during the disaster.
